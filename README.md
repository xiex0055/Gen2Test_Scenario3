# Git/GitHub Testing - Scenario 3
Repo of Ver. 2.3.75 for Git/GitHub testing

a.	Ray will create a private repository on GitHub for Version 2.3.75

b.	Ray will invite Feng and Sanghyeon as members of MWCOG organization. He then find a way to set up only one role that would be allowed to directly merge branches to master branch (and disallow this ability to the collaborators). My guess is that this capability is only available for a team license ($9 per user/month). 

c.	Change the repo to a public, and set up roles for Feng and Sanghyon

d. Test 1: 

    i.	Sanghyeon will try to work directly on the repo via his online GitHub account by creating a branch to mimic to one of the updates that we made to Ver. 2.375 and committing the change to the branch. Before asking Ray to merge the working branch to the master branch, ask Feng to double check the work on GitHub.
  
    ii.	Feng will try to work indirectly with the repo by downloading/cloning and working on his new branch of the local copy using Sublime Merge/GitHub Desktop, then push it to the original repo. Feng’s branch is completely independent from Sanghyeon’s. Feng can ask Sanghyeon for a review before requesting a merge to the master branch.
  
e.	Test 2: Both Feng and Sanghyeon will work with one file on their own different branch. The confliction will happen and Ray will try to solve it.
