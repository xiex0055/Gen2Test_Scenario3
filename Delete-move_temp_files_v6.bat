:: Usage (launched from root folder):  move_temp_files.bat <output_folder_name> 
::
:: When running the TPB Version 2.3.48 Travel Model, in addition to the useful
:: output files, such as i4_Assign_Output.net, a number of temporary ("temp")
:: files are created, such as i3_Assign_Output.net.  This program will move 
:: these temp files to a folder under the output folder.  For example, "2030_base"
:: will now include a subfolder called "temp_files".  After the batch file has
:: been run, the user may use Windows Explorer to manually delete the folders
:: containg the temp files.

:: The majority of temp files are those associated with the first four
:: speed-feedback (SFB) iterations of the model (pp, i1, i2, and i3).
:: Some of the "i3" files should be maintained, however, so this batch file
:: will restore five of the i3 files.

:: Robocopy (robust copy) is a powerful command and "robocopy /MOV" allows the
:: command to mimic the Windows move command (and even create a log file), but
:: "robocopy /MOV" is very slow, so we have refrained from using it.

:: Time delay, x, where x = (seconds of delay) - 1      Thus 6 => 5 sec. delay
set time_delay=6
